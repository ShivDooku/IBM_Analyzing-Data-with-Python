# IBM_Analyzing-Data-with-Python
Final Assignment - Analyzing where people drink

I've completed the main tasks in this final assignment from IBM, Analyzing Data with Python.
These tasks showcase basic data analysis and visualization skills using pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.

As an ending bonus, I've added a GridSearch and Interact widget to highlight hyperparameter tuning using r2 as the scorer.
Do enjoy!
